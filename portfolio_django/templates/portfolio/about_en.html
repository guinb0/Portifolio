            <p>I am a data intern at CGU (Brazilian Office of the Comptroller General), the federal government's internal control body. I perform user journey tests and cross-reference different datasets for decision support using SQL Server, Python and R.</p>
            <p>I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science and my work is focused on Data, emphasizing skills in Power BI, Python, SQL Server and R. I also have experience with web development, having worked on several projects including e‑commerce solutions and my professional portfolio.</p>
            <p>Besides my internship, I do volunteer work at the Social Observatory of São Paulo, an institution that monitors political activity in the city: from parliamentary sessions to procurement processes. There I extract and clean data for integration into analytical systems.</p>
